## Category 1: Opening & Rapport
**Weight: 10%**

### Required Script Elements
- Agent name
- "Licensed agent for First Health Enrollment"
- State they're licensed in
- Why calling: "responding to your Obamacare application that you submitted online"
- Recording disclosure: "This call will be recorded or monitored for quality and training purposes"
- Consent: "Do I have your consent to ask you a few quick questions?"

### Scoring Criteria

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **1** | Missing multiple required elements. No agent name OR no company name OR no recording disclosure. Jumped straight to questions without establishing context. Customer confused about who's calling or why. |
| **2** | Included agent name and company but missed recording disclosure OR consent request. Rushed through introduction. No attempt to build rapport or confirm it's a good time. |
| **3** | All required elements present: name, company, state licensing, reason for call, recording disclosure. Asked for consent. Delivery was adequate but mechanical or rushed. |
| **4** | Strong introduction with all elements. Natural delivery, not robotic. Confirmed customer availability. Brief rapport-building (used customer's name, acknowledged their situation). Created positive first impression. |
| **5** | Exceptional opening that immediately built trust. All compliance elements woven in naturally. Personalized the interaction. Set clear expectations for the call. Customer felt welcomed and at ease. Seamlessly transitioned to discovery. |

### Red Flags (Auto-flag for review)
- Recording disclosure completely missing
- Agent didn't identify as licensed agent
- No consent obtained before asking personal questions
- Customer expressed confusion about who was calling

---

## Category 2: Needs Discovery & Qualification
**Weight: 30%**

### Required Discovery Questions
1. Individual or family plan?
2. Current insurance status (when last insured, do they have ACA now?)
3. Zip code confirmation
4. Tax filing status (single or married)
5. Dependents claimed on taxes
6. Employment status
7. Expected 2025 household income
8. Medicaid denial check (if Sherpa shows Medicaid box)
9. Pre-existing conditions (with reassurance: "you CANNOT be denied coverage")
10. Prescription medications
11. Doctor preferences (priority to keep vs. open to any)

### Critical Decision Point
**Income qualification determines product path:**
- Income qualifies for ACA → Continue with ACA pitch
- Income too low for ACA → Switch to Balance Care (Limited Medical)

### Balance Care (Limited Medical) Transition Quality

When a customer's income doesn't qualify for ACA subsidies, agents must smoothly transition to Limited Medical. This sub-criterion is evaluated as part of the overall Discovery score.

**Good Transition (contributes to Score 4-5):**
- Recognizes income doesn't qualify for ACA subsidies promptly
- Smoothly pivots: "Based on your income, I actually have a better option for you..."
- Doesn't make customer feel bad about their income level
- Maintains energy and enthusiasm when switching products
- Still builds value and urgency for Limited Medical
- Explains what Limited Medical covers AND its limitations honestly (waiting periods, coverage gaps)
- Customer feels they're getting a good solution, not a consolation prize

**Poor Transition (contributes to Score 1-2):**
- Abrupt switch: "Oh, you don't qualify. Let me tell you about this other thing..."
- Makes customer feel like they're getting a lesser or inferior product
- Doesn't explain why they're switching products
- Loses energy or enthusiasm when switching
- Doesn't properly explain Limited Medical limitations
- Customer feels confused or disappointed about the pivot

### Scoring Criteria

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **1** | Skipped discovery entirely or asked fewer than 3 questions. Jumped to pitch without understanding customer's situation. Didn't verify income. Pitched wrong product for customer's income level. |
| **2** | Asked some basic questions (zip, filing status) but missed critical areas like income verification, pre-existing conditions, or medications. Didn't reassure customer about pre-existing conditions. May have pitched ACA to someone who didn't qualify. |
| **3** | Covered most required questions. Verified income and correctly identified ACA vs Limited Medical path. Asked about pre-existing conditions and medications. May have missed doctor preference question or didn't dig deep into customer's specific needs. Adequate but surface-level discovery. |
| **4** | Thorough discovery covering all required areas. Used the pre-existing conditions reassurance ("you CANNOT be denied coverage"). Asked follow-up questions based on customer responses. Correctly identified product path and transitioned smoothly if Limited Medical was needed. Connected discoveries to later presentation. |
| **5** | Exceptional discovery that uncovered not just facts but motivations. Asked all required questions plus insightful follow-ups. Made customer feel heard and understood. Identified specific pain points (medications, doctors, conditions) that were later addressed in presentation. Correctly identified ACA vs Limited Medical and if switching, made the transition feel natural and beneficial, not like a downgrade. Customer felt the agent truly understood their situation. |

### Red Flags (Auto-flag for review)
- Pitched ACA to customer with income below threshold
- Didn't ask about income before quoting subsidy
- Skipped pre-existing condition question entirely
- Made customer feel judged about health conditions

---

## Category 3: Product Presentation
**Weight: 20%**

### Required Presentation Elements
1. **Subsidy explanation**: "You qualified to receive a federal tax credit, otherwise known as a subsidy, totaling [AMOUNT]. This is a discount from the federal government that is applied to your health premium."
2. **Copays**: Doctor visit copay amount, generic medication copay
3. **Preventative care**: "All your preventative care visits would be covered at no charge" with gender-appropriate examples:
   - Female: mammograms, pap smears, vaccines, immunizations, annual blood tests, physicals, cancer screenings
   - Male: prostate examinations, colonoscopy, vaccines, immunizations, annual blood tests, physicals, cancer screenings
4. **Deductible and coinsurance**: Annual deductible amount, coinsurance percentage
5. **Dental benefits (CareConnect)**: "Up to 70% off all dental procedures including caps, crowns, dentures, braces, orthodontics, cleanings, X-rays"
6. **Vision benefits (CareConnect)**: "Up to 50% off all glasses, frames, lenses, contact lenses, Lasik surgery, annual eye exam covered at no cost"
7. **Accidental death benefits**: Amount (200k or 15k for MediAssist)
8. **Total price breakdown**: Health price + CareConnect price = Total

### Key Presentation Principle
> "BRING UP THEIR PAINS WE GATHERED DURING PROBING! BRING UP THE DRUGS THEY SAID THEY TAKE! TAILOR THE PLAN ACCORDING TO THOSE PAINS AND SOLUTIONS PLAN OFFERS!"

### Scoring Criteria

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **1** | Generic presentation that didn't connect to customer's needs. Missed major benefits (no mention of subsidy, or skipped preventative care, or forgot dental/vision). Used confusing jargon. Customer seemed lost or disengaged. |
| **2** | Covered basic elements but presentation felt scripted and impersonal. Mentioned subsidy and some benefits but didn't connect them to customer's discovered needs (medications, doctors, conditions). Missed dental/vision or accidental death benefits. |
| **3** | Solid presentation covering subsidy, copays, preventative care (with appropriate gender examples), deductible, dental, vision, and accidental death. Explained total price. Delivery was clear but didn't personalize much to customer's specific situation. |
| **4** | Strong presentation that referenced customer's discovered needs. Connected benefits to their specific medications, doctors, or conditions. Explained subsidy clearly. Used "don't pause" momentum technique effectively. Customer understood the value proposition. Asked clarifying questions or got verbal buy-in during presentation. |
| **5** | Exceptional consultative presentation. Wove customer's specific pain points throughout ("Remember you mentioned [medication]? That would be covered with your $X copay"). Made complex concepts simple. Built genuine excitement about the coverage. Customer felt this plan was chosen specifically for them, not a one-size-fits-all pitch. Transitioned naturally to close without awkward pause. |

### Red Flags (Auto-flag for review)
- Quoted subsidy amount without having verified income
- Gave wrong gender-specific preventative care examples
- Didn't explain that dental/vision through CareConnect is separate
- Made guarantees about specific coverage without verification

---

## Category 4: Objection Handling
**Weight: 20%**

### Common Objections & Strong Responses

| Objection | Weak Response | Strong Response |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **"Too expensive"** | "It's actually a good deal" | Reframe value: "I understand. Let's look at what you're getting: your [medication] would be covered, your doctor visits are only $X, and if anything serious happened, you're protected. Plus, without insurance, a single ER visit could be $10,000+. Does that help put the cost in perspective?" |
| **"Need to talk to spouse"** | "Okay, call me back" | "I completely understand. Is your spouse available now? I'd be happy to go over everything with both of you. If not, let's schedule a specific time when you're both free so we don't miss this enrollment window." |
| **"I'm healthy, don't need it"** | "You never know" | "That's great that you're healthy! These plans actually reward that — all your preventative care is free. But here's the thing: life is unpredictable. One accident or unexpected diagnosis, and you could face bills that would take years to pay off. This protects everything you've worked for." |
| **"Need to think about it"** | "Okay, take your time" | "Of course, this is an important decision. Help me understand — is there something specific you're unsure about? Sometimes when people say they need to think about it, there's a question I haven't answered well. What's on your mind?" |
| **"Current plan is fine"** | "Okay, if you change your mind..." | "That's good you have coverage! Out of curiosity, if you could change one thing about your current plan, what would it be? [Listen] Interesting — let me show you how this plan addresses that..." |
| **"Don't trust insurance companies"** | "We're different" | "I hear you, and honestly, I understand why people feel that way. Can I ask what happened? [Listen and acknowledge] That's frustrating. Here's what makes this different: this is an ACA plan backed by federal regulations, and I'm your agent of record — meaning I'm here to help you navigate any issues. My job isn't done when you enroll." |

### Scoring Criteria

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **1** | Ignored objections entirely or argued with customer. Gave up immediately at first pushback. Used high-pressure tactics that made customer uncomfortable. Lost the sale due to poor objection handling. |
| **2** | Acknowledged objection but response was generic or weak. Didn't uncover the real concern behind the objection. Accepted stalls ("I'll call you back") without attempting to address or schedule follow-up. |
| **3** | Addressed objections adequately. Acknowledged the concern, provided a reasonable response. Didn't fully resolve or lost momentum afterward. May have handled one objection well but struggled with follow-up objections. |
| **4** | Strong objection handling. Used empathy ("I understand"), asked clarifying questions to uncover real concerns, and provided specific responses that addressed the root issue. Maintained positive rapport throughout. Successfully redirected to value after addressing concern. |
| **5** | Expert-level handling. Anticipated objections before they arose. When objections came, listened fully, validated the concern, asked questions to understand the root cause, and turned the objection into a reason to buy. Customer felt heard and respected, not pressured. Maintained control of the conversation while making customer feel in control of their decision. |

### Red Flags (Auto-flag for review)
- Argued with or dismissed customer's concerns
- Used manipulative or high-pressure tactics
- Continued pushing after customer clearly said no
- Made promises to overcome objections that can't be kept

## Behavioral Metrics

These metrics are tracked separately from category scores.

| Metric | Target Range | Yellow Flag | Red Flag |
|--------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Agent Talk Ratio** | 45-55% | 56-65% or 35-44% | >65% (lecturing) or <35% (not leading) |
| **Total Speaking Turns** | Varies by call length | Very few turns relative to duration | Agent monologues dominating |
| **Estimated Question Count** | 8-12 | 5-7 | <5 (not discovering) |

### Talk Ratio Interpretation
- **>65% agent talk**: Agent is lecturing, not having a conversation. Customer may be disengaged.
- **45-55% agent talk**: Good balance. Agent is leading but customer is participating.
- **<35% agent talk**: Agent may not be in control of the call. Could indicate strong discovery OR lost control.

## Appendix: Script Reference

### Opening Template
```
"Hey, [customer name]! This is [agent], a licensed agent for First Health Enrollment
in the state of [state]. I'm responding to your Obamacare application that you
submitted online looking for health insurance. How can I help you?"

[After initial response]

"Excellent! Well, first and foremost, I have to mention that this call will be
recorded or monitored for quality and training purposes."
```

### Consent Request
```
"Do I have your consent to ask you a few quick questions to help search the
marketplace and find the best options for you?"
```

### Pre-existing Conditions Reassurance
```
"I want you to know that you CANNOT be denied coverage or be charged more due to
any pre-existing medical conditions. So, you can be totally honest with us without
worrying about any of those things."
```

### Subsidy Explanation
```
"Based on what you told me, you qualified to receive a federal tax credit, otherwise
known as a subsidy, totaling in the amount of [AMOUNT]. This is a discount from the
federal government that is applied to your health premium. Does that make sense?"
```

### CareConnect Clarification (for email expectation)
```
"The first email you will receive will be in regards to the dental and vision
confirmation from CareConnect. In this email, it will say very clearly THIS IS NOT
HEALTH INSURANCE — that's because it is your dental and your vision, they want to
make sure that is clear."
```

### Healthcare.gov Warning
```
"One of those emails from Healthcare.gov is going to ask you to PICK A PLAN...
DON'T DO THAT. We've done this for you. If you do it again it will only duplicate
your application and the system will automatically cancel it."
```

### Rogue Agent Warning
```
"There are some rogue agents out there that will try to call you and attempt to
change your plan or steal your business for themselves. I want you to save my
number in your phone so that if anyone else calls from a different number you'll
know they are not us."
```
